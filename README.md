I have been learning web-development recently and my goal is to become a Full-Stack Web-Developer.
Alongside that I wanted to make a fun mini Javascript Project so i decided to build a calculator with Javascript using JQuery. 

## What was used

I just used some basic
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Including JQuery

## Hope you enjoy!

This was very fun to make and I hope you like it, if you encounter a bug please let me know :)
Please be sure to check out my other projects too.
